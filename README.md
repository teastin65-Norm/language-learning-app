# Receptive Language Learning App

This Unity project is designed to help children expand **receptive (listening) language skills** through interactive item requests, tap-based selection, and positive reinforcement.

## 🎯 Purpose
Requested by **Ashton**, this app will:
- Run on **iOS** (target platform).
- Help children understand and respond to spoken and written item requests.
- Encourage vocabulary expansion and comprehension.

## 🚀 MVP Features
✅ Present 1-4 item images (apple, ball, shirt, pencil, etc.) on-screen.  
✅ Character requests an item via:
- Text prompt (e.g., “Can I have the apple?”).
- (Future) Audio prompt.

✅ User taps an item:
- If correct: show “Thank you!” and progress.
- If incorrect: gentle retry or encouragement.

✅ After X correct selections, a **mini reward scene** will allow children to move the character around for free exploration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Unity (LTS, 2D)**
- **Git & GitHub for version control**
- **OpenAI Codex for scaffolding scripts**
- Future: Xcode for iOS builds.

## 🚦 Current Status
✅ Project initialized and pushed to GitHub.  
✅ Planning MVP structure.  
🛠️ Next: Use Codex to scaffold core scripts and UI for item selection and prompts.
